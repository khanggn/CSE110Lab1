# Hello! I'm Khang Nguyen
## Who Am I?
I'm a 2nd year student at UCSD majoring in Computer Science.
## Me as a Programmer 
I **_enjoy_** coding and participating in projects.

**List of Languages I know:**
* C++/C
* Java
* Python
* HTML5
* JavaScript
* CSS
> Just because I listed a bunch of things doesn't mean I'm good at it 😳

**Pun incoming...**\
What do programmers do when they're _hungry_?\
They grab a `byte`
